# Code Refactor for Web Accessibility

## Description

This github repo is result of the work carried out on a starter code provided to re-design the webpage to enable web accessibility. Web accessibility ensures that people with disabilities can access a website using assistive technologies such as video captions, screen readers, and braille keyboards that can interpret the webiste content to users. A proper semantically designed website with the help of assisstive technology gives a whole sense of webpage to users like document structure and navigation assistance. 

The website content is designed using HTML tags with headings, subheadings, main text, navigation and images styled using different font styles, size,colour and display position. The visual experience helps user interpret contents based on how it is styled. However, this is does not aid users with disabilities. HTML provides an array of semantic tags to group the information under meaningful tags so that the assitive technologies can interpret to the user with meaningful keywords. 

A proper semantically designed website with the help of assisstive technology gives a whole sense of webpage to users like document structure and navigation assistance. Making a website accessible is also good for business for many reasons, one of them being that accessible sites are better positioned in search engines like Google.
